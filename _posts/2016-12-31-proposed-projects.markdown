The Library is just getting started, and we need your help. Make [issues] with proposals and ideas for content and help us prioritize it. There are other [WoTMUD] resources out there, and we don't need to duplicate all their efforts, but it is to duplicate some -- just as libraries would have copies of books.

New content should be made with the idea of keeping things in character whenever possible. For content that just doesn't make sense to include in such contexts, please flag it as "ooc" in the categories. Later we can find an appropriate home and way to separate that content.

Project Ideas:

- Homeland stat data and statistical analysis. (Currently other sites provide either grossly too much information or too little)
- Prettified trainers. The existing trainers are great, but they're not user friendly. It would be fun to provide alternatives.
  * A nice web-friendly form that is easy to use
  * Eventually a mud-like interface allowing you to try things out there and get feedback in a mud-like environment.
- A mud-like interface to the content. Navigate rooms of the library and see shelves and shelves of books, manuscripts, etc. You
  can then read that content in some fashion. (Let's work out together exactly how that would look!)
- Script libraries, tutorials, and discussions. Help newer players learn about it so they're not so dependent on "copy/paste/pray."
